## Special Programs

### YFPI — Holding Rewards Program**

We have launched Holding Rewards Program from 22 Sept. Under this program, we will take a snapshot each day of the YFPI holders addresses and they will be rewarded with YFPI tokens. This Program will remain live until staking goes live and rewards will be distributed after 30th September.

The estimated annual yield is 50% for holding YFPI.
Snapshot will be taken each day between 2 PM and 3 PM UTC. You need to hold YFPI during this time to get rewards.

****Note**- Do not get confused Holding Rewards Program with YFPI- Earn and YFPI- Vault. They are separate products and will go live within one month of listing.


## Core Products

### YFPI Vaults

 Vaults are like decentralized open access banks where Lending, borrowing and farming can go together.

- Farming other tokens
- Provides liquidity
- Lending and Borrowing at the best possible rates
- Manages collateral at a safe level
- Stable coin finance
  
### YFPI Earn

#### What is YFPI Earn?

- Earn -YFPI Earn is a different kind of yield aggregator. It scans the other lending platform and provides the highest yield automatically to the yield farmers.
- Deposit ETH, USDC, and USDT and it will automatically do the rest to grow your passive income.

#### How does it work?

- Once yield farmers provide liquidity to the pool, they don’t have to do anything. The whole process is automated with the help of sophisticated bots.
- Bots do instant arbitrages, compares highest yield across different platforms and provides short term on demand liquidity to the requirement of other projects.

## YFPI APY
### Introduction
- The annual percentage yield (APY) is the real rate of return earned on a savings deposit or investment taking into account the effect of compounding interest.
- YF Passive income provides a fixed yield to the liquidity providers up to the point it remains sustainable.
- Expected APY for early Liquidity Providers can go up to 720%-1000% over a year.
- As soon as, the LP grows in numbers and it become unsustainable to provide high APY, YFPI vault will be activated for the full-fledged services.

### How do I calculate my rewards?
- In YFPI, APY is fixed for the initial period until the pool become unsustainable to pay the high yield.
- As soon as, the LP grows in numbers and it becomes unsustainable to provide high APY, YFPI vault will be activated for the full-fledged services.

### Fees
- 0.2% fee on funds withdrawn from the Liquidity Pool every time. This is to offset the fixed high rate of APY.
- When every harvest is called 5% fee will be deducted to make room for new Liquidity Providers.
